# CGOL----game-of-life (Java Processing 4.4.1)
A Game of Life Simulation. Controls for random vs custom seed setting, speed slider, generation counter, wall collider control, slideshow control, grid control.

Controls are as follows:
Press Space to start sim. press 'w' to toggle wall collision.  press 'p' to toggle slideshow mode --> while in slideshow mode, press space to move forward by one generation and '.' to move forward at full speed. press 'c' to toggle grid. press't' to reset into custom mode, and 'r' to reset into random mode. Hold 'q' to paint in custom mode, and 'e' to erase.  PRESS 'G' TO TOGGLE GUI (while sim is running).

This is a generative art program; you can watch the evolution of a cell population from a custom drawing, or a randomised seed. It is a 'lavalamp program'; a program to run in the backround as if it were a sophisticated cellular lavalamp art intsallation.
